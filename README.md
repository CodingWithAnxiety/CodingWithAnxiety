## Hello, there.

I am Sylvia Roselie, a hobbyist programmer interested particularly in linux and networking.

I will say I love working with low-level languages, but truthfully I've never finished anything outside of python to dateâ€” Though I wish to change that soon.

### I am currently working on: 
- My own Akkoma instance
- RMLint 
- My personal website

### I am currerntly learning:
- How to create my own websites.

### GPG key(s):

#### Sylvia Roselie <roseswilt@pm.me>
I use this key to sign all my git commits, ssh, etc. It is secured on a yubikey, so you can rest 100% assured that I am in control of it when it is used.
